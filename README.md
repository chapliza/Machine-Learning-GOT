There are approximately 2,000 characters in A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. 
The task is to predict which characters in the series will live or die (based on the data from the first 5 books), 
and give data-driven recommendations on how to survive in Game of Thrones. 
The code includes:

* Feature engineering
* Variable selection
* Model development
